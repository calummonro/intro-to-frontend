## Phase 1: Basics

1. Learn basic HTML - common tags and attributes
    - h1, h2, etc, p, strong, em, ul, li, div, span, input, button, textarea

2. Learn basic CSS
    - layout: flexbox
    - colour: background-color, color, rgb
    - text: font rules, letter-spacing, text-transform
    - shadows: box-shadow

3. Project: build a basic, static website
    - idea: Albert Shakespeare website
        - basic page layout - navbar, sidebar? main area
	- different pages: about, contact, gigs, videos
	- embed youtube videos, bandcamp songs
	- use fake text for speed: https://www.lipsum.com/
    - I wouldn't spend too long on this, but make sure you are comfortable about how a website is built and styles
    - You will likely hit walls and need to google. This is the way :D
        - tip: try and find the correct word for your google search - you will get what you want much faster
	    - e.g. "html image attributes", "css selector"
    - HTML = content (also known as "markup")
    - CSS = styling

4. Learn basic JavaScript (1)
    - data types
    - variables
    - if statements
    - for loops
    - functions
    - objects

5. Project: fizzbuzz
    ```
    Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 

    For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 

    For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 

    For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
    ```

    See if you can crack this - if you can, you have loops (for) and conditionals (if) down
    tip: look up the "modulo" (%) operator in JavaScript

5. Learn web browser technology
    - RESOURCE: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ ("official" JS documentation and tutorials here)
    - Chrome DevTool
    - Document Object Model (DOM)
    - window object
    - document object


6. Learn basic JavaScript (2)
    - document.createElement
    - document.querySelector
        - updating the DOM programatically

... todo - a bit later on in the journey:


JavaScript video series I mentioned on the phone:
- some of it may be a bit dated, so i'll comment on which vids are worth watching and which can be skipped
- probably none of it could be skipped - just need an awareness that some of the stuff mentioned isn't as common these days

Learn intermediate JS
- promises, network requests, fetching data
- code organisation
...?

Learn JS Framework: React
